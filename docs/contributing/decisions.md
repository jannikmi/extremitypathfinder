# Decision log

Decided trade-offs, newest first, including the rejected options
(cf. [Trade-offs and decisions](workflow.md#trade-offs-and-decisions)). Entry format:

```markdown
## <decision> (#<issue or pull request>)

- **Decided by:** a maintainer (link) | the contributor | an agent
- **Rejected:** <options, each with the main reason>
- **Details:** <link to the full reasoning, if any>
```

Entries are not edited, except that a maintainer confirms an agent decision by changing **Decided by**,
and a revised decision gets a new entry that marks the old one **superseded**.
Earlier decisions are described in the {ref}`Design Decisions <design_decisions>` and the issues linked there.

## Trade-offs are decided before larger changes and recorded in this log (#179)

- **Decided by:** a maintainer
- **Rejected:** no explicit rule: decisions, in particular by agents, stay invisible to reviewers.

## A short log linking to the reasoning, which stays where it is read (#179)

- **Decided by:** an agent
- **Rejected:** only the existing pages: no place for decisions about the development, "who decided" not recorded,
  past decisions spread over several pages. Full records in the log: duplicate the design page.
